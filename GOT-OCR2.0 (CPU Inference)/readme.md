# GOT-OCR2.0 (CPU Inference)

This repository provides a **CPU-compatible implementation of GOT-OCR2.0** to extract text from images. It is lightweight, easy to set up, and runs without requiring a GPU.

---

## Features

* Runs GOT-OCR2.0 **fully on CPU**
* Extracts text directly from images
* Easy setup with `requirements.txt`
* Works on Windows
